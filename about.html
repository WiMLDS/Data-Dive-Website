					Well, you get a couple of beers with your friends at an East Village bar, you start
					talking about healthcare, you start talking about data, you get really enthusiastic,
					you start emailing your friends. They like the idea, they get on board, you start meeting regularly and you realize ... it’s a lot of work to plan a data dive!
                </p>
                <p>
					Then, you continue meeting regularly ...
                </p>
                <p>
					Planning the data dive has been and still is a lot of work, yes, but also a lot of fun. We, the organizers,
					all knew each other somehow (six degrees of separation). The experience of organizing the data dive provided
					us with the opportunity to see each other regularly (great!) and to do what we like: address an important problem and work towards a common goal with data.
                </p>
                <p>
					There are going to be no prizes at the data dive, instead we focus on collaborative effort. The goal is important,
					let’s work together. Besides fixing healthcare, we hope to provide people with the opportunity to learn from each
					other. You are great at R, learn from someone who knows python. You are into SQL, perhaps you’d like to try visualization?
                </p>

							I once sat in a doctor’s chair and realized I was unable to afford the medical treatment I needed.
							And it’s not even that I didn’t have insurance. It was a bad day. I believe tech and data has the
							potential to change healthcare for the better: increased transparency for a start will help you make
							informed decisions about your health. As a Program Director at Insight Data Science, and former Data S
							cientist at Oscar, I’m lucky enough to be part of the data science community in New York and excited
							about what we can achieve if we set our minds to it.
